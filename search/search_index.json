Video streaming enables users to view videos online without having to download them. Streamed video content can include movies, TV shows, YouTube videos and livestreamed content. The term streaming refers to the continual transmission of audio and video files from a server to a client. In video streams, content is sent in a compressed form over the internet and is displayed by the viewer in real time. The media is sent in a continuous stream of data and is played as it arrives.</p>"},{"location":"advanced_topics/","title":"Advanced Topics","text":""},{"location":"basics/","title":"Basics of Streaming","text":"<p>Video streams normally begin with a prerecorded media file hosted on a remote server. Once the server receives a client request, the data in the video file is compressed and sent to the requesting device in pieces. Audio and video files are broken into data packets, where each packet contains a small piece of data. A transmission protocol, much of the time either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), is used to exchange data over a network. Once the requesting client receives the data packets, a video player on the user end will decompress the data and interpret video and audio. </p>"},{"location":"basics/#video-basics","title":"Video Basics","text":""},{"location":"basics/#audio-basics","title":"Audio Basics","text":""},{"location":"definitions/","title":"Definitions","text":""},{"location":"drm/","title":"Digital Rights Management (DRM)","text":""},{"location":"drm/#importance-of-drm-in-protecting-content","title":"Importance of DRM in protecting content.","text":""},{"location":"drm/#popular-drm-solutions-and-their-implementation","title":"Popular DRM solutions and their implementation.","text":""},{"location":"encoding_and_decoding/","title":"Encoding and Decoding","text":""},{"location":"encoding_and_decoding/#video-codecs","title":"Video Codecs","text":""},{"location":"encoding_and_decoding/#audio-codecs","title":"Audio Codecs","text":""},{"location":"format_and_technologies/","title":"Formats and Technologies","text":""},{"location":"format_and_technologies/#evolution-of-video-and-audio-formats-over-the-years","title":"Evolution of video and audio formats over the years.","text":""},{"location":"format_and_technologies/#emerging-technologies","title":"Emerging technologies","text":""},{"location":"ingest_and_cdn/","title":"Ingest and CDN","text":""},{"location":"ingest_and_cdn/#how-content-is-ingested-for-streaming","title":"How content is ingested for streaming.","text":""},{"location":"ingest_and_cdn/#role-of-content-delivery-networks-cdn-in-ensuring-smooth-delivery","title":"Role of Content Delivery Networks (CDN) in ensuring smooth delivery.","text":""},{"location":"packaging_and_delivery/","title":"Packaging and Delivery","text":""},{"location":"packaging_and_delivery/#containers","title":"Containers","text":""},{"location":"packaging_and_delivery/#delivery-methods","title":"Delivery Methods","text":""},{"location":"players_and_playback/","title":"Players and Playback","text":""},{"location":"players_and_playback/#role-of-video-players-in-various-devices-and-platforms","title":"Role of video players in various devices and platforms.","text":""},{"location":"players_and_playback/#features-compatibility-and-challenges-in-video-playback","title":"Features, compatibility, and challenges in video playback.","text":""},{"location":"resources_and_further/","title":"Resources and Further Reading","text":""},{"location":"tools_and_monitization/","title":"Tools and Monetization","text":""},{"location":"tools_and_monitization/#tools","title":"Tools","text":""},{"location":"tools_and_monitization/#monetization","title":"Monetization","text":""}]}
